# Learning
This repository is about my interests and my little experiements.
I like to work both on hardware and software. With the little time I spent on learning, I usually watch random videos on youtube about Programming (Python or C).
Nowadays, I am working on Cadence Virtuoso Software and in process of learning Verilog.
I have a background in Electrical Engineering and with ongoing Master's in Electrical Systems Engineering.
